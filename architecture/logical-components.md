## ‚úÖ Notes

- Core microservices require **rich domain models** with aggregates, entities, and events.
- Supporting microservices may use **simpler models** or external libraries.
- Generic microservices should rely on **off-the-shelf solutions** when possible.
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, reporting) should not duplicate business logic.

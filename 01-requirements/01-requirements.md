# ðŸ“Œ Requirement: Loan Origination System

The Loan Origination System allows users to browse loan products (e.g., personal loans, mortgages, auto loans) with details such as interest rates, terms, and eligibility criteria.

Users can then submit a loan application by providing identity and contact information. Supporting financial documents are pulled automatically through third-party services. Credit checks and verifications are performed without manual intervention.

Once all verifications and underwriting are complete, the system makes a decision automatically and notifies the borrower via email. Borrowers can log in at any time to track their application status.

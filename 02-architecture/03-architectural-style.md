# ðŸ“Œ Architectural Style Analysis

## **Monolith Architecture Analysis**

**Pros**
- Simpler to develop, deploy, and test initially.
- Easier to maintain transactions and shared database consistency.
- Ideal for small teams or MVP implementations.
- No inter-service communication overhead.

**Cons**
- Scaling is coarse-grained: the entire application must be scaled, not individual components.
- Harder to maintain and extend as the system grows (loan origination, underwriting, notifications, investor reporting).
- Tightly coupled modules reduce flexibility and increase risk of changes affecting unrelated functionality.
- Difficult to adopt different technologies for different modules.

## **Microservices Architecture Analysis**

**Pros**
- Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently (Borrower Service, Loan Application Service, Underwriting, Notification Service, etc.).
- Supports elasticity, fault tolerance, and resilience in high-volume mortgage processing.
- Services own their data, improving isolation and data access control.
- Encourages domain-driven design alignment: core, supporting, and generic subdomains map naturally to microservices.
- Event-driven communication allows asynchronous processing and better handling of long-running workflows (e.g., verification, underwriting, notifications).

**Cons**
- Higher initial complexity and operational overhead (service discovery, monitoring, messaging, distributed transactions).
- Performance can be affected due to inter-service calls; mitigations include caching and minimizing chatty communication.
- Requires careful design of API contracts and message formats.
- Deployment and debugging are more complex than a monolith.

## **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Analysis**

**Pros**
- Highly responsive and scalable for asynchronous processing (loan verification, credit pull, underwriting events).
- Works well with long-running workflows and process managers.
- Supports eventual consistency across services.

**Cons**
- Not all operations require events; some synchronous queries (loan product lookup, borrower details retrieval) are simpler without EDA.
- Complexity in tracking events and handling failure scenarios.
- Requires robust monitoring and error-handling strategy.

## **Winning Choice**

Based on our analysis, **Microservices architecture** is selected for the Mortgage Loan Origination System.
- It aligns with the **DDD subdomains** and **bounded contexts**.
- Allows independent scaling of high-volume services (Loan Application, Underwriting, Notification).
- Supports event-driven workflows where necessary (verification, underwriting, notifications) while keeping synchronous interactions where simpler.

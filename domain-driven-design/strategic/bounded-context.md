# Loan Origination System ‚Äì Bounded Contexts

This document identifies **Bounded Contexts** for each subdomain of a Loan Origination System (LOS).  
Each bounded context encapsulates its own domain model, ubiquitous language, and service boundary.

## üîë Core Subdomains ‚Üí Core Bounded Contexts

1. **Loan Application & Workflow Management**  
   **Bounded Context:** *Loan Application Context*
    - Captures borrower applications, manages workflow states, orchestrates the process.

2. **Credit Decisioning & Risk Assessment**  
   **Bounded Context:** *Credit Decisioning Context*
    - Owns scoring models, risk evaluation, bureau integration, decision outcomes.

3. **Underwriting Rules & Policy Enforcement**  
   **Bounded Context:** *Underwriting Context*
    - Contains underwriting policies, eligibility rules, exception handling.

4. **Loan Offer & Pricing Engine**  
   **Bounded Context:** *Loan Offer Context*
    - Produces loan offers, calculates pricing, terms, and repayment schedules.

## ‚úÖ Key DDD Takeaways

- Each **subdomain maps to a bounded context**.
- **Core bounded contexts** require rich, evolving domain models (strategic investment).
- **Supporting bounded contexts** encapsulate domain-specific logic but are not competitive differentiators.
- **Generic bounded contexts** can often be implemented via off-the-shelf solutions.
- Context boundaries guide **microservice design**, ensuring each service has a clear, consistent language.

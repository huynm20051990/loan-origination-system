# ðŸ“Œ Mortgage System - Bounded Contexts by Subdomain (Updated)

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a **Bounded Context** defines the boundaries within which a particular domain model is consistent and has its own language, rules, and logic.

## **Core Domain Bounded Contexts**

| **Subdomain** | **Bounded Context** | **Description** |

| Loan Origination | Loan Application Context | Handles borrower intake, loan product selection, application submission, and initial validation. |
| Underwriting | Underwriting Context | Evaluates borrower risk, creditworthiness, DTI/LTV ratios, and generates underwriting findings. |
| Loan Decision Engine | Loan Decision Context | Applies final decision rules, calculates risk score, approves or rejects the loan. |

## **Generic Domain Bounded Contexts**

| **Subdomain** | **Bounded Context** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Auth Service | Authentication Context | Handles authentication, authorization, SSO, OAuth2, and Keycloak integration. |
| User Service | User Management Context | Manages user profiles, roles, groups, and account status. |

### **Notes**
- Supporting Bounded Contexts now include previously generic mortgage-specific services like Credit, Investor, Escrow, and Document services.
- Generic Bounded Contexts handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, user management, logging, reporting, and integrations.
- Each context owns its **domain model, rules, and logic**, and communicates with others via **events or APIs**.

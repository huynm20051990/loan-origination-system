### **Notes**
- Terms are mapped to their **subdomains and bounded contexts** to maintain clarity and consistency.
- Core domain terms define the unique, strategic differentiators of the mortgage system.
- Supporting terms provide auxiliary functions that support core workflows.
- Generic terms cover cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure services.

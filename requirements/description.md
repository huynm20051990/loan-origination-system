# ðŸ“Œ Requirement: Loan Origination System

## **Description**
Users can view available loan products (such as personal loans, mortgages, and auto loans) along with interest rates, terms, and eligibility criteria before applying.

After reviewing, they can submit a loan application by providing personal and financial details. Users can upload supporting documents, and the system performs a credit check through an external provider.

A loan officer then reviews the application, and upon approval, the user is notified. Users can also log in to check their application status.

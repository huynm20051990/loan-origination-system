# ðŸ“Œ Requirement: Loan Origination System

## **Description**
The Loan Origination System allows users to browse loan products (e.g., personal loans, mortgages, auto loans) with details such as interest rates, terms, and eligibility criteria.

Users can then submit a loan application by providing identity and contact information. Supporting financial documents are pulled automatically through third-party services. Credit checks and verifications are performed without manual intervention.

Once all verifications and underwriting are complete, the system makes a decision automatically and notifies the borrower via email. Borrowers can log in at any time to track their application status.
